Notes:
- planned fixes:
   - fix the small memory leak caused by pressing the f key
   - fix quest info too long one line in popup
   - Fix specific item words:
      - BLACKLIST WORD BODY
      - paper thinks interchange paper map 

- Extra datapoint ideas:
   - "best_to_sell" either the trader or market
      - market_price minus market_fee vs trader price

Settings to make:
   - popup time length
   - popup opasity
   - information checkboxes
      - last_price, 24_avg, trader, trader_price, quest_info, best_to_sell, best_to_sell_price


Limitation(s):
The program can't differentiate loose ammo types that arent unique. IE  pst gzh (9x19 or 9x18, and etc)
there's just not enough information in the text box to differentiate
