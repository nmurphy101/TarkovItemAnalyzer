Notes:

fix the large memory leak caused by the remaking of the keyboard listener

fix the small memory leak caused by pressing the f key

fix the "overall" tab compare image getting convered up when
the popup is overlayed.

fix quest info too long one line in popup

Fix specific item words:

Extra datapoint ideas:
 - "best_to_sell" either the trader or market
   - market_price minus market_fee vs trader price

Settings to make:
 - popup time length
 - popup opasity
 - information checkboxes
    - last_price, 24_avg, trader, trader_price, quest_info, best_to_sell, best_to_sell_price



Limitation:
The program can't differentiate loose ammo types that arent unique. IE  pst gzh (9x19 or 9x18, and etc)
